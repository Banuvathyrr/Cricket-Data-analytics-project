- Following Data preprocessing steps performed using Pandas :
  
    a) data extracted from json file and data frame created  
    b) columns renamed

## Data analysis
  - Preprocessed data (available in the form of csv file) imported to Power BI
  - removed unnecessary characters or symbols in the column by using extract
